//! MicrogridSite-level event stream — fans out telemetry samples and topology
//! version bumps to UI subscribers (the WebSocket endpoint, future
//! command-line monitors, anything else that wants live notifications).
//!
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` is multi-producer / multi-consumer with a
//! bounded ring; if a subscriber falls behind by more than the ring
//! capacity it gets a `RecvError::Lagged` and skips ahead. That's the
//! right tradeoff for a UI: the chart is stale anyway when the tab
//! has been backgrounded for an hour, no value in queueing every
//! missed sample.
