//! Enterprise-wide grid frequency model. One Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
//! process per process, shared across every microgrid in the
//! registry — microgrids tied to the same AC grid all see the
//! same frequency by physics, so it lives outside per-MicrogridSite
//! state — the registry-shared driver writes once per step and
//! every site reads from the same slot via `grid_state()`.
//!
//! The driver task spawned by `spawn_driver` steps the state
//! forward every `STEP_MS` ms with the discrete Euler-Maruyama
//! update of the OU SDE:
//!
//!   dF = -k * (F - F_nominal) * dt + σ * sqrt(dt) * N(0, 1)
//!
//! `k` (mean reversion rate, 1/s) sets the correlation time
//! (~1/k seconds); `σ` (Hz/sqrt(s)) sets the noise floor — the
//! equilibrium standard deviation is σ / sqrt(2k). Defaults:
//! k = 0.05, σ = 0.015 → ~47 mHz std dev around 50 Hz with a
//! ~20-second correlation window. Same order of magnitude real
//! grid operators see at the dispatch dashboard.
//!
//! Scenarios that need a specific frequency event (UFLS dip,
//! generator-trip overshoot + recovery, etc.) call
//! `(override-frequency-model …)` to swap in different OU parameters
//! (e.g. pull toward a lower nominal); the driver keeps integrating
//! with those until `(clear-frequency-override)` restores the base
//! model.
